VRouter is a widget which allows you to create your routing structure via the `routes` attribute. It should often be placed at the top of the tree and there should only be one in your app. Its `routes` attribute takes VRouteElements, which will be the building blocks of your routing system.

Note that It also acts as a MaterialApp so you can pass it all the usual MaterialApp arguments.''',

There are different VRouteElement classes based on your needs. The most basic is VStacked.
VStacked takes a widget and stacks it on top of another VRouteElementâ€™s widget. This idea of stack is important for nested routes, which we will see later.

For now, we can already create a simple app with 2 routes:''',

On any platform, there is already a transition between the routes. You will be able to customize it later of course. 
On the web, this handles the navigator back/forward button, and handles a url typed directly in the browser search bar.

For now, the only way to navigate is by typing a new url. Not very practical, especially on mobile! In the next chapter, Programmatic Navigation, we should see how to navigate with a button press.
